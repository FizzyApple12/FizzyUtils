## What is this?

FizzyUtils is a collection of utilities I use for my mods. This includes: 
 * **Anonymous mod usage tracking**
 * Leaderboarding

do note: All of the data recorded is 100% anonymous with no tracking data what so ever. If you would like to opt out anyways, set ``sendData`` to ``false`` in the config and it will disable all features in bold.

<br/>

## What libraries or other plugins does it need?

 * BSIPA
 * websocket-sharp

## Great! How do I get it?

You can either download a released version from the releases tab or build it yourself.

Here are the steps to build the Project:

1. Link all of the DLLs from the Beat Saber directory

2. Build the project

3. Copy ``FizzyUtils.dll`` to the ``Plugins`` folder

4. That's it! You're done!
